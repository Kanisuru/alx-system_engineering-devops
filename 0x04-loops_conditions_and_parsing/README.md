Shellcheck
Shellcheck is a tool that will help you write proper Bash scripts. It will make recommendations on your syntax and semantics and provide advice on edge cases that you might not have thought about. Shellcheck is your friend! All your Bash scripts must pass Shellcheck without any error or you will not get any points on the task.

To install Shellcheck type:

sudo apt-get install shellcheck
For every feedback, Shellcheck will provide a code that you can use to get more information about the issue, for example for code SC2034, you can browse SC2034.

Manpage
Most of Unix systems are managed by using Shell. Just as you need to know a minimum number of words to have a discussion in a language, you need to know a minimum number of commands to be able to easily interact with a system. Unix systems all have, sometimes with slight differences, the same set of commands. While it is not too hard to remember commands, it might be hard to remember all of their options and how exactly to use them. The solution to this is the man command. Letâ€™s go through a part of the ssh one, as there are few elements to know to be able to read a man page:

NAME
ssh â€” OpenSSH SSH client (remote login program)

SYNOPSIS
ssh [-1246AaCfgKkMNnqsTtVvXxYy] [-b bind_address] [-c cipher_spec] [-D [bind_address:]port] [-E log_file] [-e escape_char] [-F configfile] [-I pkcs11] [-i identity_file] [-L [bind_address:]port:host:hostport] [-l login_name] [-m mac_spec] [-O ctl_cmd] [-o option] [-p port]
[-Q cipher | cipher-auth | mac | kex | key] [-R [bind_address:]port:host:hostport] [-S ctl_path] [-W host:port] [-w local_tun[:remote_tun]] [user@]hostname [command]

DESCRIPTION
ssh (SSH client) is a program for logging into a remote machine and for executing commands on a remote machine. It is intended to replace rlogin and rsh, and provide secure encrypted communications between two untrusted hosts over an insecure network. X11 connections and arbitrary TCP ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
Some tips:
The NAME will summarize what the command is doing. As it is usually super short, you might want to look at DESCRIPTION (bellow) if ever it does not gives clear enough information
The SYNOPSIS will help you to understand the structure of the command:
   A shell command usually have this format: command options parameters
   Options inside [] are optional
   The string without [] are mandatory
ssh [-1246AaCfgKkMNnqsTtVvXxYy] [-D [bind_address:]port]
   ssh is mandatory
       -1246AaCfgKkMNnqsTtVvXxYy is optional
       -D [bind_address:]port is optional (with bind_address: being itself optional within -D [bind_address:]port
Commands
Here is the (non-exhaustive) list of commands & concepts you should master to be verbose with Unix systems:

Shortcuts
Some handy shortcuts:

CTRL+A # go to beginning of line
CTRL+B # moves backward one character
CTRL+C # stops the current command
CTRL+D # deletes one character backward or logs out of current session
CTRL+E # go to end of line
CTRL+F # moves forward one character
CTRL+G # aborts the current editing command and ring the terminal bell
CTRL+K # deletes (kill) forward to end of line
CTRL+L # clears screen and redisplay the line
CTRL+N # next line in command history
CTRL+R # searches in your command history
CTRL+T # transposes two characters
CTRL+U # kills backward to the beginning of line
CTRL+W # kills the word behind the cursor
CTRL+Y # retrieves last deleted string
CTRL+Z # stops the current command, resume with fg in the foreground or bg in the background
0. Create a SSH RSA key pair
Read for this task:

How do I set up SSH authentication keys in Linux or Mac?
How do I set up SSH authentication keys in Windows?
man: ssh-keygen

You will soon have to manage your own servers hosted on remote data centers. We need to set them up with your RSA public key so that you can access them via SSH.

Create a RSA key pair.

Requirements:

Keep the private key to yourself in a secure location, you will use it later to connect to your servers using SSH. Some storing ideas are Dropbox, Google Drive, password manager, USB key. Failing to do so will prevent you to access your servers, which will prevent you from doing your projects.
If you decide to add a passphrase to your key, make sure to save this passphrase in a secure location, you will not be able to use your keys without the passphrase
SSH and RSA keys will be covered in depth in a later project.

when you generate an rsa key two files are generated: "id_rsa", "id_rsa.pub":

"id_rsa.pub" is the public key, It is the one that we are going to use at point 0 of the project, we must change its name.
"id_rsa": It is the private key and it is the one that must be kept in a confident place
